   Syn: To paint; dye; blot; soil; sully; discolor; disgrace;

          to impart color to its substance. To stain is said
          chiefly of solids, as wood, glass, paper; to dye, of
          fibrous substances, textile fabrics, etc.; the one,
          commonly, a simple process, as applying a wash; the
          other more complex, as fixing colors by mordants.
